/* x- The header text is size 32px and weight 900. 
x- The header text is vertically centered and 16px from the edge of the screen. 
x- The footer is pushed to the bottom of the screen (the footer may go _below_ the bottom of the screen if the content of the 'cards' 
section overflows and/or if your screen is shorter). 
x- The footer text is centered horizontally and vertically. - The sidebar and cards take up all available space above the footer. 
x- The sidebar is 300px wide (and it doesn't shrink).
x- The sidebar links are size 24px, are white, and do not have the underline text decoration. 
x - The sidebar has 16px padding. - There is 32px padding around the 'cards' section. 
- The cards are arranged horizontally, but wrap to multiple lines when they run out of room on the page.

- The number of cards lined up in that section will change based on the width of your screen,
so don't stress about getting _exactly_ a 2x3 or 3x2 grid.
x- You will need to change the flex-direction to push the footer down. 
x- You will need to add some divs as containers to get things to line up correctly. 
- `flex-wrap` will help get the cards aligned correctly. 
- Make sure you define how much space the cards should take up, in order for `flex-wrap` to work as intended. */
